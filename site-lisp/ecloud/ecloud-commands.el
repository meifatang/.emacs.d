`kubernetes-kubectl--default-error-handler', which logs an error
if the process exited unexpectedly.
Optional CLEANUP-CB is a function of no arguments that is always
called after the other callbacks.  It can be used for releasing
resources.
After callbacks are executed, the process and its buffer will be killed.
